What are Hidden Markov Models?

HMMs are statistical models that deal with systems that transition between different "hidden" states. We can't directly observe these states, but we can observe "emissions" or outputs that depend on the hidden state.   

Think of it like this: Imagine you have a friend who tells you about their mood every day ("happy," "sad," "neutral"). You can't directly see their mood (the hidden state), but you can infer it based on what they tell you (the emission).  HMMs help you model this kind of situation.   

Key Components of an HMM:

Hidden States: The unobservable states of the system (e.g., market regimes like "bullish," "bearish," or "sideways").   
Observations: The observable outputs or emissions that depend on the hidden states (e.g., price movements, trading volume, volatility).   
Transition Probabilities: The probabilities of transitioning between different hidden states (e.g., the probability of going from a "bullish" state to a "bearish" state).   
Emission Probabilities: The probabilities of observing different outputs given a particular hidden state (e.g., the probability of a large price increase given a "bullish" market).   
How HMMs are Used in Trading:

Market Regime Identification:

HMMs can be used to identify different market regimes (e.g., trending, volatile, sideways) by analyzing price data, technical indicators, and other relevant information.   
By understanding the current market regime, traders can adapt their strategies and make more informed decisions.   
Predicting Market Shifts:

HMMs can help predict potential shifts in market regimes by analyzing historical data and identifying patterns in transitions between states.   
This allows traders to anticipate changes in market behavior and adjust their positions accordingly.

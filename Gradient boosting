Absolutely! ThymeBoost is another great option for time series forecasting, making it suitable for stock price prediction. Here's how you can use it in Python:
Installation:
pip install ThymeBoost


Data Preparation:
Similar to before, gather historical stock data and engineer features.
Ensure your data is in a pandas DataFrame with a datetime index.
Model Training:
from ThymeBoost import ThymeBoost

model = ThymeBoost()
model.fit(y_train)  # Input only the target variable (stock prices)


Prediction:
y_pred = model.predict(fh)  # fh is the forecast horizon (number of periods to predict)


Evaluation:
Use MSE, MAE, or other relevant metrics to assess model performance.
Key Advantages of ThymeBoost:
Automatic time series decomposition (trend, seasonality).
Flexibility to combine different forecasting models.
Simple API.
Example:
import pandas as pd
from ThymeBoost import ThymeBoost

# ... (Load and prepare data as before)

model = ThymeBoost(
    trend_estimator='linear',
    seasonal_estimator='fourier',
    exogenous_estimator='xgb'
)
model.fit(y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(fh=30)  # Predict next 30 days


Feel free to experiment with different estimators and hyperparameters to fine-tune the model.
